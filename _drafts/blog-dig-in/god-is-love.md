# it‘s all about Love… God's love.

God’s love - definition
- possessive form - the love belonging to God.
	- see - how God loves.
	- see - how God is to be loved. 
	- see - how God intends for all to love. 
- as a contraction - God is love
	- see - what love is and how the Bible explains that God is love and love is God. 
		- NOTE: must not confuse God's definition of love with the worlds definition of love, while they may look similar and share some characteristics, there are critical differences; one primary difference is in prioritizing the objects of our love. God say love him (truth and light, and honor what he has created) first, then your brother as yourself (which places all people, to include self and others on an equal playing field). The world would say love self first or in some case others leaving out God (truth and light). This distortion allows for sin. 

			
What is the nature (spirit) of God, it is love.  Love has three primary facets creation, salvation, and restoration. Love created all. Love is capable of saving all. Love is able to restore all. Love seeks to place the world (people) back in right relationship with itself, which puts everything back in order.
What does it mean to be in the right relationship with love. 
	- To acknowledge God creation first its harmony and sanctity, the value of others and self.
	- Do not confuse love with only being familial, our love is to be for all.
	
Love the, nature (spirit) of God is God, and expressed in all three forms:
- the Father (YHWH) - expressed all three facets of Love in the Old Testament. ASIDE: Primarily credited with Creation.
	- Examples of Creation:
	- Examples of Salvation:
	- Examples of Restoration:
- the Son (Jesus) - expressed all three facets of Love in the New Testament. ASIDE: Primarily credited with Salvation.
	- Examples of Creation:
	- Examples of Salvation:
	- Examples of Restoration:
the Holy Spirit (In us) - when embraced, expresses all three facets of Love in us today. ASIDE: Primarily credited with Restoration
	- Examples of Creation:
	- Examples of Salvation:
	- Examples of Restoration:
	
How each teaches about God’s Love:
- the Father (YHWH) - through the law, and Old Testament
	- Moral 
	- Civil
	- Ceremonial 
- the Son (Jesus) - through sacrifice, clarifying the law, and the New Testament
- The Holy Spirit (In Us) - through "the most intimate of relationship" powered by our understanding and acceptance of both the law and sacrifice. NOTE: Father I need clarity on this one. 
	

<aside>
	Theological arguement of the characteristics of God
	Note: Omnibenevolence is part of Christianity
	Omnipotent, Omniscient, Omnipresent, and Omnibenevolence God
	- Omnipotent - all powerful
	- Omniscient - all knowing 
	- Omnipresent - all present (everywhere at once)
	- Omnibenevolence - all good

	My questions:
	- How does the Bible support God having these characteristics?
	- Is it the fact that God is "all good", that keeps the other three in check.
