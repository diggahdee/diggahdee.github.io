In 1 Corinthians, Paul is writing a letter to a church he planted in Corinth. In his letter he addresses a list of subject that was plaguing the church at that time. 1 Corinthian 12 Paul changes subject from “the Lord's supper" to "spiritual gifts". Not switching subject again until around 1 Corinthian 14:26, at least not completely, where he switches subject to what the ESV titles “Orderly worship". Let's dig in...

## 1 Corinthians 12:1-3 ESV
> **1 Corinthians 12:1-3 ESV**
> *12 - 1 Now concerning spiritual gifts, brothers, I do not want you to be uninformed. 2 You know that when you were pagans you were led astray to mute idols, however you were led. 3 Therefore I want you to understand that no one speaking in the Spirit of God ever says “Jesus is accursed!” and no one can say “Jesus is Lord” except in the Holy Spirit.*

**POINTS FROM THE VERSES:**

- Paul wants to clear up a misunderstanding:
	- the world (pagan world) has a concept of "spiritual gifts".
		- *"1 Now concerning spiritual gifts, brothers, I do not want you to be uninformed. 2 You know that when you were pagans you were led astray to mute idols, however you were led."* - 1 Corinthian 12:1-2
	- the Jewish church, those who claim to be believers but are not following the "Spirit of God", has a concept of "spiritual gifts".
		- *3 Therefore I want you to understand that no one speaking in the Spirit of God ever says “Jesus is accursed!”* - 1 Corinthian 12:3~
	- those following the "Holy Spirit" has a concept of "spiritual gifts". 
		- *"and no one can say “Jesus is Lord” except in the Holy Spirit."* - 1 Corinthians 12:~3
