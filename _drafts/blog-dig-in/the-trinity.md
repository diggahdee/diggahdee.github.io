Note: Love - Godly Love versus World Love. In this article I will attempt to share my views on “Love” and it's link to God and trinity doctrine. When I use the word "Love", unless stated otherwise I will be referring to Godly Love, which is to Love as God intended, not "Worldly love", which is to accept a worldly or man made view of love.


The Holy Trinity or Trinity Doctrine is both a controversial and difficult topic to discuss. There are primarily two items frequently debated, while believers may simply accept (but often struggle to explain), non-believers struggle even harder to get past:
1. The word "Trinity" ("The Trinity") - is not in the Bible. 
2. The concept of "God" being three in one.

As a believer I might attempt to use terms like "spirit" or "nature" to explain it is three "entities" (the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit) that share the same "nature" and are all God. This is usually met with blank stares or immediate rebuttals. What if I changed it to say the “nature" is God or God's. Three entities that share the same “nature” and while the Father (YHWH/Elohim) is God. His nature which is part of his Godhead is in his Nature which is in all three… Yup, I’m still confused too. Let me explain. 



Love the, nature (spirit) of God is God, and expressed in all three forms (that Godly Love has presented itself):
- the Father (YHWH) - expressed all three facets of Love in the Old Testament. ASIDE: Primarily credited with Creation.
	- Examples of Creation:
	- Examples of Salvation:
	- Examples of Restoration:
- the Son (Jesus) - expressed all three facets of Love in the New Testament. ASIDE: Primarily credited with Salvation.
	- Examples of Creation:
	- Examples of Salvation:
	- Examples of Restoration:
the Holy Spirit (In us) - when embraced, expresses all three facets of Love in us today. ASIDE: Primarily credited with Restoration
	- Examples of Creation:
	- Examples of Salvation:
	- Examples of Restoration:
	
How each teaches about Godly Love:
- the Father (YHWH) - through the law, and Old Testament
	- Moral 
	- Civil
	- Ceremonial 
- the Son (Jesus) - through sacrifice, clarifying the law, and the New Testament
- The Holy Spirit (In Us) - through "the most intimate of relationship" powered by our understanding and acceptance of both the law and sacrifice. NOTE: Father I need clarity on this one. 

Order matters. 
- God the Father was the first to have the nature (spirit of Love), it is his nature. 
	- QUESTION: is it the only possible nature for one who is.
- God the Father past the nature (spirit of Love) to the Son.
- The Son passed access to nature (spirit of Love) to all. 


God the Father (Elohim) - Since the beginning desired to create a kingdom. A kingdom not governed by any king, or judge or person, but one that is ruled by his spirit (Love - spoken to man in the form of the 10 commandments in the OT or 2 in the NT)

... Man failed to. Failed to understand God (Elohim) spirit, failed to submit to his commandments, because man failed to see past himself, failed to operate in Love for Elohim and love for his brother.

In love, God showed man the truth of their nature and the kingdom that they desired. No man by his own spirit will bring peace and purpose to the world. With patience God (Elohim), continue to rescue and remind man what they trully needed, His spirit (his nature). 

Since the beginning he intended for that nature to rule, but man needed to see it in action, and see how serving the flesh (man's self-centered nature will fail), while serving the spirit (Elohim's nature) redeems, removes all sin, gives peace and purpose. God in his infinite wisdom knew the day would come. Knew he would have to show man his glory his way. Show man first how man's desired kingdom was flawed and now (new testament) show man how it could/should be. Enters the Messiah that has been spoken of throughout the Old testament.

God (Elohim) new he had to show man how to love (his nature), show them the power and purpose in it, and get them to desire to live in/by it. God sent his spirit his will (wrapped in flesh... Jesus), his nature to live the life we were suppose to live and die the only death we were intended to, the death to self for God (Elohim's) Kingdom. Showing us the glory, the power of Jesus purpose (our purpose, cause it was ours first) being full filled, what the enemy is and what God's (Elohim's) intended kingdom looks like. This king, this master was the power on earth since the beginning that man gave/gives away. 

Jesus completes his purpose as God (Elohim) willed. Fullfills his role as High Priest, Chief shepard, teacher, master... example. Leaving no doubt what the life, purpose and glory that waits for one who accepts God (Elohim's) ways (nature). Casting out doubt for those who would accept Elohim's ways. Jesus as Elohim's embodied nature returned to the father to wait to "judge" the acceptance of Gods spirit/will. 

Befor Jesus transcended he left believers behind who accepted his ways, but may still have doubted his power. The power to overcome the world. They accepted the truth of God (Elohim), the truth of Jesus (his spirit and will for us), and in acceptig this. Believing in, Jesus (Elohim's will) Man spirit is made Holy (man receive the Holy Spirit). Man is once again connecte in spirit to God (Elohim). This spirit reminds us of who Elohim is, what his will is for us and his will is for our brothers and sisters. As always intended this spirit, this will, the word of God (Elohim), his commandments govern the hearts and spirits of his people not the flesh. That teaching spreads by discipleship. Disciples make disciples (followers of Gods (Elohim's) ways). Connection is once again made through the "Holy" spirit to God and our brothers. Connected by a commom purpose, a common desire to seek the will of the Almighty God (Elohim) to be ruled by his will. That his kingdom will come. 




**Holy Spirit** man accepts Christ thus accepting God as the truth his nature as the truth and puts his faith in his nature thus given a direct connection with God the Father
