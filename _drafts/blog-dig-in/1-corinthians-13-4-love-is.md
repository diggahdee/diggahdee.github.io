# The Ask...  
## Find examples of, "the love" defined in 1 Corinthian 13:4-12 in the old testament.

1 Corinthians 13:4-12 is probably one of the most recognized verses of scripture on love, but is this a New Testament concept or is this "love" expressed in the Old Testament? Let'take a look.

<span class="scripture">
> **1 Corinthian 13:4-12 ESV**
> *4 Love is patient and kind; love does not envy or boast; it is not arrogant 5 or rude. It does not insist on its own way; it is not irritable or resentful; 6 it does not rejoice at wrongdoing, but rejoices with the truth. 7 Love bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.
8 Love never ends. As for prophecies, they will pass away; as for tongues, they will cease; as for knowledge, it will pass away. 9 For we know in part and we prophesy in part, 10 but when the perfect comes, the partial will pass away. 11 When I was a child, I spoke like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child. When I became a man, I gave up childish ways. 12 For now we see in a mirror dimly, but then face to face. Now I know in part; then I shall know fully, even as I have been fully known.*

**LET'S PUT THE SCRIPTURE IN CONTEXT (It's better in context):**

In 1 Corinthians, Paul is writing a letter to a church he planted in Corinth. In his letter he addresses a list of subject that was plaguing the church at that time. 1 Corinthian 12 Paul changes subject from “the Lord's supper" to "spiritual gifts". Not switching subject again until around 1 Corinthian 14:26, at least not completely, where he switches subject to what the ESV titles “Orderly worship". Let's dig in...

## 1 Corinthians 12:1-3 ESV
> **1 Corinthians 12:1-3 ESV**
> *12 - 1 Now concerning spiritual gifts, brothers, I do not want you to be uninformed. 2 You know that when you were pagans you were led astray to mute idols, however you were led. 3 Therefore I want you to understand that no one speaking in the Spirit of God ever says “Jesus is accursed!” and no one can say “Jesus is Lord” except in the Holy Spirit.*

**POINTS FROM THE VERSES:**

- Paul wants to clear up a misunderstanding:
	- the world (pagan world) has a concept of "spiritual gifts".
		- *"1 Now concerning spiritual gifts, brothers, I do not want you to be uninformed. 2 You know that when you were pagans you were led astray to mute idols, however you were led."* - 1 Corinthian 12:1-2
	- the Jewish church has a concept of "spiritual gifts", those who claim to be believers but are not following the "Spirit of God".
		- *3 Therefore I want you to understand that no one speaking in the Spirit of God ever says “Jesus is accursed!”* - 1 Corinthian 12:3~
	- those following the "Holy Spirit" has a concept of "spiritual gifts". 
		- *"and no one can say “Jesus is Lord” except in the Holy Spirit."* - 1 Corinthians 12:~3

**My Thoughts:**

I feel Paul is sharing that their are three perspectives on spiritual gifts, the world, the misguided believer and the true believer. I also have some concerns in the definition of “spiritual gifts". There is some confusion for me because based on my understanding in verse 1 the word gift was added by translators and didn’t actually appear in the original text. Could this change my understanding of the text. Let’s continue by breaking down some definitions. 

**DEFINITION DEEP DIVE:**

- ***"spiritual gifts"*** - I find it interesting and a little off that the word "gift" here has no definition in Strong's concordance. Only the word "spiritual". A little research/googling uncovered that the word [gift](http://lectionarygreek.blogspot.com/2010/01/1-corinthians-121-11.html) isn't in the original text but added by translators, "based on context". 
	- **"spiritual" or "[pneumatikos (Greek - Strong's Concordance)](https://www.biblestudytools.com/lexicons/greek/kjv/pneumatikos.html)".**
		1. relating to the human spirit, or rational soul, as part of the man which is akin to God and serves as his instrument or organ
				- that which possesses the nature of the rational soul
		1. belonging to a spirit, or a being higher than man but inferior to God
		1. belonging to the Divine Spirit
			- of God the Holy Spirit
 			- one who is filled with and governed by the Spirit of God
		1. pertaining to the wind or breath; windy, exposed to the wind, blowing 
	- **gifts or [charisma (Greek - Strong's Concordance)](https://www.biblestudytools.com/lexicons/greek/nas/charisma.html)** - Note: the word gift isn't actually present in the greek translation. It was chosen to be added by whoever translated from greek to english. The absence of the word gift in that verse can have an impact on the meaning. The sentence goes from, "Now concerning spirtual gifts", to "Now concerning (the) spiritual (human spirit, or rational soul, or a spirit, or divine spirit of God the Holy Spirit)". For the sake of arguemen (that the context warrants gift) let us use the greek word for gift found in the verses that follow 1 Corinthian 12:4.
			1. a favour with which one receives without any merit of his own
			1. the gift of divine grace 
			1. the gift of faith, knowledge, holiness, virtue
			1. the economy of divine grace, by which the pardon of sin and eternal salvation is appointed to sinners in consideration of the merits of Christ laid hold of by faith
			1. grace or gifts denoting extraordinary powers, distinguishing certain Christians and enabling them to serve the church of Christ, the reception of which is due to the power of divine grace operating on their souls by the Holy

**ASIDE:**

I have been taught,(or understood) that "spirtual gifts", were bestowed by the Holy Spirit, and that the Holy Spirit was only in believers, so therefore believers are the only ones with access to “spiritual gifts". Assuming it is true that only "believers have access to the Holy Spirit”. How does changing the text from "spiritual gifts" to spiritual" change my understanding. Does it? 
If the word gift was not present, but instead only spritual (pneumatiko), meaning "relating to the human spirit", or "belonging to the divine spirit". Then is whatever is being handed out only available to believers?

## 1 Corinthians 12:4-7 ESV
> **1 Corinthians 12:4-7 ESV**
> *4 Now there are varieties of gifts, but the same Spirit; 5 and there are varieties of service, but the same Lord; 6 and there are varieties of activities, but it is the same God who empowers them all in everyone. 7 To each is given the manifestation of the Spirit for the common good.* 

**POINTS FROM THE VERSES:**

- Their are a variety of Gifts, Services and Activities, but for each Paul distinguishes their source.
	- Gifts - *"4 Now there are varieties of gifts, but <mark>the same Spirit</mark>;"* - 1 Corinthians 1:4
	- Services - *"5 and there are varieties of service, but <mark>the same Lord</mark>;"* - 1 Corinthians 1:5
	- Activities - *"6 and there are varieties of activities, but it is  <mark>the same God</mark> who empowers them all in everyone."* - 1 Corinthians 1:6

**My Thoughts**

Paul takes the time to call out gifts, service and activities independently and associate each with a source. Paul is trying to teach us something here, but what. I see two things that could be going on here: 

1. If I was arguing that all spiritual gifts come from the Holy Spirit I might say that he is using repetition. Saying the same thing over and over again but using synonyms to ensure understanding. NOTE: The trinity doctrine is not losses on me here, but if the trinity is represented then is their significance in which part of the trinity is present in each thing?
2. If I was arguing that they are three separate things, with three distinct sources, I might say he is communicating that their is a distinction between the three and there associated source or purpose. 

I lean toward option 2, in the verses that follow, Paul takes the time to define gifts, services (another word used is ministries, and activities independently. What is the difference between gifts, services, and activities? 
Paul also highlights three different associations. Gift and the "Spirit", services and the "Lord", and activities and "God" (God the Father).  Why is this significant? What’s the difference? Lastly what does Paul mean in verse 13:~6-7, *"God who empowers them all in everyone. To each is given the manifestation of the Spirit for the common good."* Is everyone, everyone regardless of acceptance of Jesus. Let us continue. 

## 1 Corinthian 12:8-11 ESV

> **1 Corinthian 12:8-11 ESV**
> *8 For to one is given through the Spirit the utterance of wisdom, and to another the utterance of knowledge according to the same Spirit, 9 to another faith by the same Spirit, to another gifts of healing by the one Spirit, 10 to another the working of miracles, to another prophecy, to another the ability to distinguish between spirits, to another various kinds of tongues, to another the interpretation of tongues. 11 All these are empowered by one and the same Spirit, who apportions to each one individually as he wills.*

**POINTS FROM THE VERSES:**

- The following gifts are "given through the Spirit… the same Spirit":
	1. "the utterance of **wisdom**" -
	1. "the utterance of **knowledge**" -
	1. "**faith**" -
	1. "**gifts of healing**" -
	1. "**prophecy**" -
	1. "ability to **distinguish between spirits**" -
	1. "**various kinds of tongues**" -
	1. "**the interpretation of tongues**" -

**My Thoughts**

By what Spirit are are these gifts given? Are these gifts, gifted to anyone or only those with the "Holy Spirit"?

## 1 Corinthian 12:12-13 ESV

> **1 Corinthian 12:12-13 ESV
> *12 For just as the body is one and has many members, and all the members of the body, though many, are one body, so it is with Christ. 13 For in one Spirit we were all baptized into one body—Jews or Greeks, slaves or free—and all were made to drink of one Spirit.*

**POINTS FROM THE VERSES:**

- I believe Paul is using symbolism here to get the point across that We, the collective "we" are one body (one "whole"), connected and bound to each other as people, as we also are bound together as people under Christ. 
	- In the verse Paul speaks of one connected body (whole), then he transitions to say, "so it is with Christ". Some translate that line to "so also is Christ". It’s comparing or associating a quality with one thing then assigning or associating that same quality to another. 
	- Paul uses very inclusive language, like the word "all". 
		- "**For in one Spirit we were <mark>all</mark> baptized into one body—Jews or Greeks, slaves or free—and <mark>all</mark> were made to drink of one Spirit.**" - 1 Corinthian 12:13
	- Paul goes one step further to make sure he calls out all people, "Jew or Greek" (representing non Jews some translate to gentiles), "slave or free". He doubles up on making it clear that "all", really means "all".
			- **aside** - I believe Jew or Greek was to represent cultural and or religious status, while slave or free was to represent socioeconomic status. 
	- "One Spirit" put us here into the body the whole, but we were "all made (designed) to drink of one Spirit". 
	- In verses 14-26 I see Paul explaining how we are all connected, and have a purpose to play, whether we agree or not.

**My Thoughts**

God is not exclusive, "in one Spirit we were all baptized into one body", and all are "made to drink of one Spirit". The word choice here is what I believe throws many off. As a Christian the word "baptized" has a very specific association for me. I associate it with baptism or to accept Jesus, but it simply means to be immersed, and there are so many references to the "body" and Christ that I immediately make that association, but "body" also means whole or collective. In the verse that follows he says, "so it is with Christ", in other versions of the Bible is reads, "so also is Christ". Seems like he is speaking of a second body (group or collection). Digging in more. There is a whole that we were all immersed into, a whole designed to drink of one Spirit. 
By one Spirit We were all born into this world (given the first breath of life) and we were all designed to accept, acknowledge drink of one Spirit. There is a simple beauty to these words. God made us and we were designed to drink in the same spirit that was placed in us. All of us without exception who are on this earth was given life and designed by God for him. The missing piece that we chafe in things and people. I can talk about this for day but, in the verses that follow 14-26, Paul goes on to explain whether one accepts it or not they are a part of the one body.

<spam class="aside">

**Is the Christian God partial or impartial?**

God the Father is not an exclusive God he is an inclusive God. Making all available to all his children. It is and has always been up to his children to accept the truth, accept his grace, accept his love that he pours out indiscriminately on all. Yes God does have his "chosen people" throughout the Old Testament, but are they chosen to be "set apart" as a class of people or set apart as a people who follow him and not the ways of the world. God is love and loves all. He makes the sun shine and the rain pour on the sinner and the Saints. He showers the truth and grace on those who accept him and those who do not. My brothers and sisters we have to be careful about being “classist and egregious" as the Pharisees were of Jesus day. They set themselves apart, thus missing the Messiah they had been longing for altogether. While he came as the Old Testament explained he would, one of the primary reasons they missed him, is he didn’t come and set them apart.

## 1 Corinthian 12:14-26

> **1 Corinthian 12:14-26
> *14 For the body does not consist of one member but of many. 15 If the foot should say, “Because I am not a hand, I do not belong to the body,” that would not make it any less a part of the body. 16 And if the ear should say, “Because I am not an eye, I do not belong to the body,” that would not make it any less a part of the body. 17 If the whole body were an eye, where would be the sense of hearing? If the whole body were an ear, where would be the sense of smell? 18 But as it is, God arranged the members in the body, each one of them, as he chose. 19 If all were a single member, where would the body be? 20 As it is, there are many parts, yet one body.
> 21 The eye cannot say to the hand, “I have no need of you,” nor again the head to the feet, “I have no need of you.” 22 On the contrary, the parts of the body that seem to be weaker are indispensable, 23 and on those parts of the body that we think less honorable we bestow the greater honor, and our unpresentable parts are treated with greater modesty, 24 which our more presentable parts do not require. But God has so composed the body, giving greater honor to the part that lacked it, 25 that there may be no division in the body, but that the members may have the same care for one another. 26 If one member suffers, all suffer together; if one member is honored, all rejoice together.*


**POINTS FROM THE VERSES:**

- The body consist of more than one member. Each member is part of the body as God designed. The members do not get to opt out, but we’re arranged to be a part of it 

##1 Corinthian 12:27

27 Now you are the body of Christ and individually members of it. 28 And God has appointed in the church first apostles, second prophets, third teachers, then miracles, then gifts of healing, helping, administrating, and various kinds of tongues. 29 Are all apostles? Are all prophets? Are all teachers? Do all work miracles? 30 Do all possess gifts of healing? Do all speak with tongues? Do all interpret? 31 But earnestly desire the higher gifts.
And I will show you a still more excellent way.
> 13 - 1 If I speak in the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, I am a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal. 2 And if I have prophetic powers, and understand all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have all faith, so as to remove mountains, but have not love, I am nothing. 3 If I give away all I have, and if I deliver up my body to be burned, but have not love, I gain nothing.
4 <mark>Love is patient and kind; love does not envy or boast; it is not arrogant 5 or rude. It does not insist on its own way; it is not irritable or resentful; 6 it does not rejoice at wrongdoing, but rejoices with the truth. 7 Love bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.
8 Love never ends. As for prophecies, they will pass away; as for tongues, they will cease; as for knowledge, it will pass away. 9 For we know in part and we prophesy in part, 10 but when the perfect comes, the partial will pass away. 11 When I was a child, I spoke like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child. When I became a man, I gave up childish ways. 12 For now we see in a mirror dimly, but then face to face. Now I know in part; then I shall know fully, even as I have been fully known. </mark>
13 So now faith, hope, and love abide, these three; but the greatest of these is love.*

## Summary 
God the Father is not a God of division. He seeks to unify the body. 



**My Questions...**

- What is the verse actually refering to? aka the "context"?
- What's the definition of each of the words used to describe "love"?
- How is this love expressed in the old testament? 

======= Below this line is "scratch paper", ideas potextually to include or remove. 

Side notes want to make sure is in here:
- God seeks to unify not divide. Why would he give only to those in the church. It is a tool he uses to show believers and non believers. 


- is a spirit considered "Holy" when it accept Jesus?
- Are mute or unspeaking idols the things of the world we worship, in many cases in Paul's time these idols also had a god representation
	EXAMPLE:
		- wealth
		- power
		- family/children
		- love / a spouse

**Additional Thoughts:**	
This scripture gave me pause, specifically verses 1 and 2. It seemed so straight forward, but did't match up with what i had been taught was going on here. Take a moment and re-read 1 Corinthians 12:1-3 then put it in your own words. When done read mine...

> **1 Corinthians 12:1-3 ESV**
> *12 - 1 Now concerning spiritual gifts, brothers, I do not want you to be uninformed. 2 You know that when you were pagans you were led astray to mute idols, however you were led. 3 Therefore I want you to understand that no one speaking in the Spirit of God ever says “Jesus is accursed!” and no one can say “Jesus is Lord” except in the Holy Spirit.*

**STOP** - a useful tool to challenge understanding is to restate what you heard (in this case read) in your own word.

> **1 Corinthians 12:1-3 MOW (My Own Word... Come on that's funny)
> Now concerning the rational soul (spirtual gift), brothers, i do not want you to lack information (be ignorant), because you know before you knew God the Father you worshipped insignificant things (mute idols), based on how you were taught. Therefore i want you to understand that no one talking by (in) the Spirit of the God the Father will ever say "Jesus is accursed [anathema](https://www.biblestudytools.com/encyclopedias/isbe/anathema.html)", and no one can boast or teach ([say]()) "Jesus is Master (Lord)" except by (in) the Holy Spirit.

SAID DIFFERENTLY - its reads to me as a warning (maybe even a chastisement if you look at the verses above 1 Corinthian 11:33-34) against being led astray by false teachers (as they had before) even those who claim to know God the Father. Paul literally...YOU ARE HERE ... HOW DOES HE END THE VERSE BEFORE AND DOES HE APOLOGIZE IN HIS SECOND LETTER FOR BEING HARSH. ALSO LIMK OTHER COMMENTARIES HERE. 

</span>

Paul makes two points before diving into the spritual gift.

1. Called out non-Jews (pagans or gentiles depending on the translation) for being led astray by mute/dumb or silent idols(gods)
	- Is there significance in their idols being mute or silent? A contrast between the Jewish God (God the Father) and the other gods of the time?
2. Calls out that they (pagans or gentiles) were mislead before so in order to not be led astray again recognize the spirit your dealing with. One who is speaking in the "Spirit of God" will not say "Jesus is accursed" and one who is filled with the Holy Spirit will recognize "Jesus as Lord".
- Many of the Jews of the time didn't believe in Jesus. So while they may have spoke of God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. They may have been misrepresenting his spirit.
