Disclaimer: 
As a human I recognize it is hard to remain objective when seeking the truth, because at some point we have made up our mind and only see validation. How can I create a format that does not do this? 



YOU ARE HERE: 
- summary of trinity doctrine 
- What does Trinity Doctrine affirm? 
   TO COMFIRM: define the points. 
   - Jesus is God? 
   - God is God 
   - Holy Spirit is God.
   - definition of God  
   
   
 What is the Trinity? 
 - Generally it is summarized as follow 
 > The Christian doctrine of the Trinity defines one God existing in three <mark>coequal, coeternal, consubstantial divine persons</mark>: God the Father, God the Son (Jesus Christ) and God the Holy Spirit, three distinct persons sharing one homoousion (essence). As the Fourth Lateran Council declared, "it is the Father who begets, the Son who is begotten, and the Holy Spirit who brings about." In this context, the three persons define who God is, while the one essence defines what God is. This expresses at the same time their distinction and their indissoluble unity. Thus the whole work of creation and grace is seen as a single common operation of all three divine persons, in which each manifests what is proper to it in the Trinity, so that all things are "from the Father," "through the Son," and "in the Holy Spirit."
 > - coequal - Equal to each other in size, rank or position
 > - coeternal - 


Section ideas: 

- Hypothesis - Objective or Problem statement
- Definition - clearly lay out definition of any ambiguous terms or sentencing. 
- Evidence - Just the Facts
    - Supporting evidence - What would validate the Hypothesis? 
        - With validity rating 
        - With supporting information.
    - Negating evidence - What would invalidate the Hypothesis?  
        - With validity rating 
        - With supporting information.
 My issues: 
 - While The Fathers character is eternal, as is his plan.. he planned for, the beginning to create a world governed by his Holy (set apart) spirit. 
 - are all three God? The father .. no.. all three are part of Gods plan. 
 - I believe the statement, "'God' the Father, 'God' the Son, 'God' the Holy Spirit" is false. There is but one God (Elohim) the Father (YHWH), who sent his Son Jesus (Jehoshua) the Messiah Father's chosen as King, Lord, High Priest of the earth governed by his word because he is his word in flesh. To usher in the Kingdom The Father always intended. The Holy Spirit is God's word, sealed within us governing our thoughts and actions. 
 - The Father is 

For Evidence: 
- Can I give some sort of “validity” rating? Much of this is not scientific, but historical facts (from resources with levels of dependability) 
      - Source bias? - non partial historical accounts? 
      - potential for lost in translation - with bias.
