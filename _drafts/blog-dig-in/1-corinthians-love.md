# The Ask...  
## Find examples of, "the love" defined in 1 Corinthian 13:4-12 in the old testament.

1 Corinthians 13:4-12 is probably one of the most recognized verses of scripture on love, but is this a New Testament concept or is this "love" expressed in the Old Testament? Let's take a look.

<span class="scripture">
> **1 Corinthian 13:4-12 ESV**
> *4 Love is patient and kind; love does not envy or boast; it is not arrogant 5 or rude. It does not insist on its own way; it is not irritable or resentful; 6 it does not rejoice at wrongdoing, but rejoices with the truth. 7 Love bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.
8 Love never ends. As for prophecies, they will pass away; as for tongues, they will cease; as for knowledge, it will pass away. 9 For we know in part and we prophesy in part, 10 but when the perfect comes, the partial will pass away. 11 When I was a child, I spoke like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child. When I became a man, I gave up childish ways. 12 For now we see in a mirror dimly, but then face to face. Now I know in part; then I shall know fully, even as I have been fully known.*
