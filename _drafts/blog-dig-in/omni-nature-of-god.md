Theological arguement of the characteristics of God
	Note: Omnibenevolence is part of Christianity
	Omnipotent, Omniscient, Omnipresent, and Omnibenevolence God
	- Omnipotent - all powerful
	- Omniscient - all knowing 
	- Omnipresent - all present (everywhere at once)
	- Omnibenevolence - all good 
	
	Reference material:
	- https://study.com/academy/lesson/omnipotent-omniscient-and-omnipresent-god-definition-lesson-quiz.html
	
	My questions:
	- How does the Bible support God having these characteristics?
	- Is it the fact that God is "all good", that keeps the other three in check. 
		- Why God has laws, principles and precepts. Why Gods actions cannot "be evil" (not to say hurt/pain) is not felt as a result of God's action... creation for example)
	- Is the only possible nature for a God who is Omni-X4 to be love, because anything else would implode on itself
