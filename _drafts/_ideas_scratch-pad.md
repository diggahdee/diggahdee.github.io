- **is God spirit or a nature?** what is the difference/definition of each.


- **God answers the prayers that are in his will.** A believer seek to align themselves with God's will, therefore as a believers, our prayers will more closely align with God's will thus being answered more than a non-believer. 
NOTE: I typically differentiate non-believer (one who has not accepted Jesus out of lack of exposure or hypocricy in the church) from sinners, but the preceeding definition works for both.

- **There is no salvation without accepting God's Son, word, commandment, but their is still a God the Father.** One must acknowledge and accept God the Father word, will and ways to be saved, granted eternal access to his kingdom. without that one is lost for eternity.

- **There is so much more available to you when you have relationship with God.** So much more access to his resources and his promises. You now know what they are and how to access them. The conditions needed to ask for them.

- **God is love... What is love?**

- **Why i believe** paraphrase some of the works of C.S. Lewis - "What Christians believe"**
