To accept Jesus is to accept God is love, and to accept how much God loves you. 
It is the beginning of how God can work on and in you. You must accept that all that he has done, is doing and will do is out of Love. For you and all of his other children. It’s a change in perspective. 
By accepting Jesus you are accepting that God is the Truth and the light. That he God and his ways are the ways of life and that their is no other way. You are showing faith in God.
That realization opens the door for one to have the capacity to follow his commandments, “'You shall love the LORD your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind.' 38 This is the first and great commandment. 39 And the second is like it: You shall love your neighbor as yourself’” - Matthew 22:37-40
His love shown to others works as a seed on their hearts(mind and soul). Creating the opportunity for them to believe in Love and in turn believe in God. Accept Jesus…
