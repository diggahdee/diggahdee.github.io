## 1 Corinthian 13:1-



> 13 - 1 If I speak in the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, I am a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal. 2 And if I have prophetic powers, and understand all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have all faith, so as to remove mountains, but have not love, I am nothing. 3 If I give away all I have, and if I deliver up my body to be burned, but have not love, I gain nothing.
4 <mark>Love is patient and kind; love does not envy or boast; it is not arrogant 5 or rude. It does not insist on its own way; it is not irritable or resentful; 6 it does not rejoice at wrongdoing, but rejoices with the truth. 7 Love bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.
8 Love never ends. As for prophecies, they will pass away; as for tongues, they will cease; as for knowledge, it will pass away. 9 For we know in part and we prophesy in part, 10 but when the perfect comes, the partial will pass away. 11 When I was a child, I spoke like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child. When I became a man, I gave up childish ways. 12 For now we see in a mirror dimly, but then face to face. Now I know in part; then I shall know fully, even as I have been fully known. </mark>
13 So now faith, hope, and love abide, these three; but the greatest of these is love.*

**POINTS FROM THE VERSES**
- God intended for us to have faith in him and each other, hope in him and each other and love for him and each other. 




**STOP** - a useful tool to challenge understanding is to restate what you heard (in this case read) in your own word.

> **1 Corinthians 12:1-3 MOW (My Own Word... Come on that's funny)
> Now concerning the rational soul (spirtual gift), brothers, i do not want you to lack information (be ignorant), because you know before you knew God the Father you worshipped insignificant things (mute idols), based on how you were taught. Therefore i want you to understand that no one talking by (in) the Spirit of the God the Father will ever say "Jesus is accursed [anathema](https://www.biblestudytools.com/encyclopedias/isbe/anathema.html)", and no one can boast or teach ([say]()) "Jesus is Master (Lord)" except by (in) the Holy Spirit.

SAID DIFFERENTLY - its reads to me as a warning (maybe even a chastisement if you look at the verses above 1 Corinthian 11:33-34) against being led astray by false teachers (as they had before) even those who claim to know God the Father. Paul literally...YOU ARE HERE ... HOW DOES HE END THE VERSE BEFORE AND DOES HE APOLOGIZE IN HIS SECOND LETTER FOR BEING HARSH. ALSO LIMK OTHER COMMENTARIES HERE.
