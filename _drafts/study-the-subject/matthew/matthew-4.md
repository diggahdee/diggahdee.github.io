Significance of the Temptation (test) of Jesus - Matthew 4:1-17; Mark 1:12-13; Luke 4:1-13
Tested that as the chosen he can

Make something happen
Love by the commands of God not put own.
Not lose Gods protection or always has Gods protection
While we know we are chosen let nothing make us believe we can stray from his word.
Chose to worship other things.
Satan offers access to everything.
ASIDE: God has standards (for how we should live). Satan does not.

Outline (items to cover):

What lead up to the test?
The inauguration of Jesus. (Jesus is baptised). He is appointed the messiah (the Christ) priest, prophet and king.
Why is the test significant?
What does it mean for Jesus?
My hypothesis…
From the moment he was publicly declared the chosen by God he…(when was Jesus publicly declared God’s chosen.
Put his trust in God (Father), God’s words, and God’s commands..
In doing so he led a sinless life.
Fulfilling the requirements as an individual to receive the promise (the promise land, rulership over the promise land)
what does it mean to me as a believer
How did he do it?
What are the key elements of how he did it? Do they apply to me?
What were the test? The actual test of the devil is not found in the words of the devil, but in the response of Christ.
Jesus Baptism (his inauguration)
Up until this point there is definite rumors, buzz around that the Messiah is coming or even here. A sequence of events has occurred that would be hard to miss and the country is not that big (see timelines), but Jesus has not yet been announced into "office" as the priest, king, savior that we are waiting for. His baptism is the ceremony swearing him into position and the official announcement by God (the Father).

ASIDE: INAUGURATION. This word was applied by the Romans to the ceremony of dedicating some temple, or raising some man to the priesthood, after the augurs had been consulted. It was afterwards applied to the installation (q.v.) of the emperors, kings, and prelates, in imitation of the ceremonies of the Romans when they entered into the temple of the augurs. It is applied in the United States to the installation of the chief magistrate of the republic, and of the governors of the several states.

Jesus was (literally) publicly announced by God (Father) to be his son.
Move timelines here.

Who knew of Jesus (the Messiah) existence:

Elizabeth, wife of Zacharias, mother of John the Baptist, cousin of Mary - knew of Jesus before he was born. (Luke1:43)
Shepard in the field around Bethlehem - was visited by an angel shortly after his birth. (Luke 2:8-17)
They spread the word of what they saw… (Luke 2:17)
Simeon (a priest?) - within a few weeks of his birth Simeon saw Jesus and recognized him as the messiah. (Luke 2:25-32)
Anna (a prophetess) - in the temple at Jesus presentation to the Lord (Luke 2:36-38)
The wise men - met him around age 2 (Matthew 2);
They met him in or around the region of Bethlehem.
ASIDE: Jesus is then taken to Egypt and then Nazareth a city in Galilee; John the Baptist was around 6 months older than Jesus (Luke 1:36)

King Herod, chief priest, and scribes - was made aware by the wise men (Matthew 2)
Herod and those in the know, may have believed if the Messiah was born in or near Bethlehem, Herod had put an end to him (Matthew 2:16)
Those in power either did not know about the existence of Jesus or may not have had them on their radar.
“19 Now this is the testimony of John, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, "Who are you?"
20 He confessed, and did not deny, but confessed, "I am not the Christ."” - John 1:19-20…

“24 Now those who were sent were from the Pharisees. 25 And they asked him, saying, "Why then do you baptize if you are not the Christ, nor Elijah, nor the Prophet?"
26 John answered them, saying, "I baptize with water, but there stands One among you whom you do not know. 27 It is He who, coming after me, is preferred before me, whose sandal strap I am not worthy to loose."” - John 1:24-27

ASIDE

John the Baptist was watched from infancy, due to the circumstances of his birth. Luke:1:65
At 12 Jesus impressed the teachers in Jerusalem.. and was aware of “his fathers business” (Luke 2:45-49)
When John the Baptist came out of the wilderness preaching repentance, the people questioned if he was “the Christ” or not. (Luke 3:15)
My thoughts:

One cannot look at the "temptation" (testing) of Jesus without looking at the event that led up to it.

Jesus has just been baptized...
Jesus received the Holy Spirit/the Spirit of God/the Spirit
Jesus was announced by a voice from heaven to be the son of God, whom God was pleased with.
?? Before this was Jesus announced, presence known or more.... A prophecy still. Word of mouth. I heard?
Matthew 3:13-17 NKJV

Then Jesus came from Galilee to John at the Jordan to be baptized by him. And John tried to prevent Him, saying, "I need to be baptized by You, and are You coming to me?"

But Jesus answered and said to him, "Permit it to be so now, for thus it is fitting for us to fulfill all righteousness." Then he allowed Him.

When He had been baptized, Jesus came up immediately from the water; and behold, the heavens were opened to Him, and He saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and alighting upon Him. And suddenly a voice came from heaven, saying, "This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased."

Mark 1:9-11 NKJV

It came to pass in those days that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized by John in the Jordan. And immediately, coming up from the water, He saw the heavens parting and the Spirit descending upon Him like a dove. Then a voice came from heaven, "You are My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased."

Luke 3:21-22 NKJV

When all the people were baptized, it came to pass that Jesus also was baptized; and while He prayed, the heaven was opened. And the Holy Spirit descended in bodily form like a dove upon Him, and a voice came from heaven which said, "You are My beloved Son; in You I am well pleased."

John 1:29-34 NKJV

The next day John saw Jesus coming toward him, and said, "Behold! The Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world! This is He of whom I said, 'After me comes a Man who is preferred before me, for He was before me.' I did not know Him; but that He should be revealed to Israel, therefore I came baptizing with water."

And John bore witness, saying, "I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove, and He remained upon Him. I did not know Him, but He who sent me to baptize with water said to me, 'Upon whom you see the Spirit descending, and remaining on Him, this is He who baptizes with the Holy Spirit.' And I have seen and testified that this is the Son of God."

The story begins with right after Jesus was baptized, where God the Father announces this, "This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased." (Matthew 3:17)

ASIDE:

Why was Jesus baptized? Was it that...
He must to fulfill the word of Father.
It is the moment where Father declared him as his son the messiah. Our king to be... "his chosen"
Matthew 4:5-7- in my words.

Satan, "You are his chosen, his people, his children. You can defy God and nothing will happen." Jesus reminded us not to test our God and what happened to those who did."

Temptation (test) in the wilderness...

Matthew 3:13-17 - in my words.

Satan, "you are chosen, God loves you, you can get what you want, what you need without God." Jesus rebuttal, nothing has value, nothing nourishes without God

Matthew 4:1-4 NKJV

Then Jesus was led up by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil. And when He had fasted forty days and forty nights, afterward He was hungry. Now when the tempter came to Him, he said, "If You are the Son of God, command that these stones become bread." But He answered and said, "It is written, 'Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds from the mouth of God.'"

Luke 4:1-4

Then Jesus, being filled with the Holy Spirit, returned from the Jordan and was led by the Spirit into the wilderness, being tempted for forty days by the devil. And in those days He ate nothing, and afterward, when they had ended, He was hungry. And the devil said to Him, "If You are the Son of God, command this stone to become bread." But Jesus answered him, saying, "It is written, 'Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word of God.'"

Mark 9:12-13

Immediately the Spirit drove Him into the wilderness. And He was there in the wilderness forty days, tempted by Satan, and was with the wild beasts; and the angels ministered to Him.

My thoughts.

Satan challenges Jesus to take charge over his situation.
He did not take matters into his own hands but humbled himself to the will and test of the Father.
Points:

(is this the theme:" there relationship to God is the reason they didn't have to follow the word of God")

Jesus was tempted;
His flesh "wanted"/"was appealed to" ... aka "he was hungry" (Matthew 4:2)
His time of fasting had concluded... "afterward he was hungry (Matthew:4:~2)/" afterwards, when they had ended, He was hungry" (Luke 4:~2)
While the fast had ended the enemy was encouraging christ to take matters into his own hands... He was "dared(challenged)" to "by his own will take control over the situation and handle his needs", on his terms and not the Father's terms.
This would have bypassed the sovereignty of that (the spirit) which led him and instructed him to be in the wilderness in the first place.
The bread that he would have created would not have been accompanied by the word of God???
The devil challenged him to make bread, satiate his hunger... But Jesus said it is not bread alone.... But the word of God...
This would have disqualified Jesus from the promise of God (see Deuteronomy 8) because it would not have been sourced by God, but by Jesus means.. (doing)
Covers what must be done to receive the promise... Jesus did it where none of flesh had or could before... Deuteronomy 8:1...
Side note. 2 times Jesus says to Satan you should only do what the Lord says. Satan says but if you follow me you can do as you please.

Your connected to the holy you will not fall from grace (salvation)

If you are who God says you are:

Demand your needs be met.(you can demand your needs are met.. The only thing we need is Father)
You cannot fall.. No harm or loss of salvation.
Do not test that father will protect you from falling from a holy place
Follow me and you make the rule. Do as you want to.
Jesus did what it take to receive the promise.. Matthew 4:1-4

Jesus did what it take to keep the promise

Matthew 4:8-10 NKJV

Again, the devil took Him up on an exceedingly high mountain, and showed Him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory. And he said to Him, "All these things I will give You if You will fall down and worship me." Then Jesus said to him, "Away with you, Satan! For it is written, You shall worship the LORD your God, and Him only you shall serve.'"

My Thoughts

Satan told Jesus (tells us) you can indulge in everything the world has to offer if we will fall down and worship him....
While it's not explicitly said is it safe to say if we indulge in the world then we are worshiping Satan?
