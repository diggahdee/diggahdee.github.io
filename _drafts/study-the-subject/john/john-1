> ** John 1:1-5 NKJV **
> 1 In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. 2 He was in the beginning with God. 3 All things were made through Him, and without Him nothing was made that was made. 4 In Him was life, and the life was the light of men. 5 And the light shines in the darkness, and the darkness did not comprehend it.



Is there an association with 
- the Word and Love 
- the Light and Truth

The word is love, love is the truth, the truth that brings life, the truth that is the light that those who do not dwell in it do not understand. 

Love is creation, love is sacrifice, love is salvation, love is restoration

We as humans waste so much time arguing the exhistance, point or word of God. That we miss the nature of God and that the point is to embrace the nature of God. Which is love. We are to embrace Love.
