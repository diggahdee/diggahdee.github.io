# John (Book of John) 2 - Commentary

## John 2:1-12

**My thoughts:**


> ** John 2:1-12 NKJV **
> *1 On the third day there was a wedding in Cana of Galilee, and the mother of Jesus was there. 2 Now both Jesus and His disciples were invited to the wedding. 3 And when they ran out of wine, the mother of Jesus said to Him, "They have no wine."
4 Jesus said to her, "Woman, what does your concern have to do with Me? My hour has not yet come."
5 His mother said to the servants, "Whatever He says to you, do it."
6 Now there were set there six waterpots of stone, according to the manner of purification of the Jews, containing twenty or thirty gallons apiece. 7 Jesus said to them, "Fill the waterpots with water." And they filled them up to the brim. 8 And He said to them, "Draw some out now, and take it to the master of the feast." And they took it. 9 When the master of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine, and did not know where it came from (but the servants who had drawn the water knew), the master of the feast called the bridegroom. 10 And he said to him, "Every man at the beginning sets out the good wine, and when the guests have well drunk, then the inferior. You have kept the good wine until now!"
11 This beginning of signs Jesus did in Cana of Galilee, and manifested His glory; and His disciples believed in Him.
12 After this He went down to Capernaum, He, His mother, His brothers, and His disciples; and they did not stay there many days.*

** POINTS FROM THE VERSE (SIMPLE TRUTHS) **

- Jesus addressed the concerns of his mother (they are out of wine), even when her request conflicted with "his timing". 
	- Scripture - John 2:4 (Note: minimal changes in Jesus response between versions of the Bible)
		- NKJV - "*Jesus said to her, "Woman, what does your concern have to do with Me? <mark>My hour has not yet come.</mark>"*" 
		- ESV - "*And Jesus said to her, “Woman, what does this have to do with me? <mark>My hour has not yet come.</mark>”*" 
		- NIV - "*“Woman, why do you involve me?” Jesus replied. “<mark>My hour has not yet come.</mark>”*"
		- NLT - “*Dear woman, that’s not our problem,” Jesus replied. “<mark>My time has not yet come.</mark>”"*"
	- Questions to ask yourself:
		- His "hour for what", has not come? 
	- Consider:
		- Is this an example of honoring your mother and father… even when the timing of the request don't work for you?
		- Is this an example of a believers faith being rewarded when they take there cares to Jesus, put their faith in him? 
		- Is this an example of the petition of a believer influencing God's timing. 
- Jesus mother brought both her concerns and resources to Jesus. (John 1:3;5) NOTE: Not saying both were needed, just present. 
	- Consider:
		- Jesus mother‘s confidence (faith) that he could do something. 
- Servants, following the instructions of Jesus witnessed a miracle. (John 1:5-10)
	- Consider:
		- Nothing in the passage communicates if the servants believed in Jesus they did as instructed. 
		- As people who follow the instructions of Jesus, what miracles might we see?
- In the book of John this is the first miracle Jesus performed. 

## John 2:13-21

> **John 2:13-21. NKJV**
> *13 Now the Passover of the Jews was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem. 14 And He found in the temple those who sold oxen and sheep and doves, and the money changers doing business. 15 When He had made a whip of cords, He drove them all out of the temple, with the sheep and the oxen, and poured out the changers' money and overturned the tables. 16 And He said to those who sold doves, "Take these things away! Do not make My Father's house a house of merchandise!" 17 Then His disciples remembered that it was written, "Zeal for Your house has eaten Me up."
18 So the Jews answered and said to Him, "What sign do You show to us, since You do these things?"
19 Jesus answered and said to them, "Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up."
20 Then the Jews said, "It has taken forty-six years to build this temple, and will You raise it up in three days?"
21 But He was speaking of the temple of His body. 22 Therefore, when He had risen from the dead, His disciples remembered that He had said this to them; and they believed the Scripture and the word which Jesus had said.*

**POINTS FROM THE VERSE:**

- This story takes place over Passover, the yearly celebration of when God delivered the Hebrews from slavery in Egypt and spared the first born (male) of all who obediently marked their door post with the blood of a spotless lamb. [learn more.](https://www.gotquestions.org/what-is-Passover.html)
- This scene is presumed to take place in the outer courts of the temple, which would be the only place that merchants would have been allowed at the time. This is also the only place that gentiles (non-Jews of the time) would have been allowed to visit. Along with any ceremonially unclean Jews.

</aside>

Passover is a yearly celebration held in Jerusalem honoring what God did for the Isrealite people. After years of slavery God employed Moses and Aaron to confront Pharoah to free his people. God had to use 10 plagues in order to motivate Pharoah to, "let his people go". The last of the plagues involved the death of every first born male in Egypt. God gave very clear instructions to the Israelites (Exodus 11:4-12:20), that ended with them marking their door post with the blood of a spotless lamb so that when the "plague of death" passed through Egypt it would not enter their home. As part of the instructions, God ordered that the Israelites celebrate a yearly 7 day festival (the Festival of unleavened bread) in remembrance of what the Lord had done for them. Note as part of Gods instructions:
- Passover is to be celebrated every year by the festival of unleavened bread.
	- No work ("doing business") outside of the preparation of food was to be done during the first and last day of the festival.
	- Holy assembly must be observed on the first and last day. 
- They were literally given instructions for how to eat in remembrace of God rescuing them from slavery and death. 
The Jews were selling sacrifices for the atonement of sin in the temple. Jesus drove out those selling these animal sacrifices (typically used for burnt, sin, peace and guilt offerings). When Jesus was asked by what authority does he stop the selling of sacrificial animals. He pointed at his death and resurrection as his authority, which would serve as the last sacrifice needed for the atonement of sin. (1 John 2:2)

- Jesus had no patience for those who treated his Father's house as a house of merchandise.
	- Consider:
		- Jesus reaction is very physical grafting a whip and physically driving sheep and oxen out, along with pouring out changers' money and overturning tables. 
		- This took place in the [outer court](https://www.gotquestions.org/Court-of-the-Gentiles.html), where the gentiles were allowed to worship.
		- The merchants were “selling” atonement for sin. In front of the last wage for sin. 
			- When was one to sacrifice a ox, a sheep, or a dove? 
- Jesus was challenged by the Jews as to by what authority does he drive out the merchants. He responds, "Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up again." Literally if you take my life I will take it back.

## John 2:22-25

> **John 2:22- 25 NKJV**
> * 23 Now when He was in Jerusalem at the Passover, during the feast, many believed in His name when they saw the signs which He did. 24 But Jesus did not commit Himself to them, because He knew all men, 25 and had no need that anyone should testify of man, for He knew what was in man.*
