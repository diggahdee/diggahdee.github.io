> ** John 1:1-5 NKJV **
> *1 In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. 2 He was in the beginning with God. 3 All things were made through Him, and without Him nothing was made that was made. 4 In Him was life, and the life was the light of men. 5 And the light shines in the darkness, and the darkness did not comprehend it.*


** My Thoughts: **

Is there an association with 
- the Word and Love 
- the Light and Truth

The word is love, (selfless) love is the truth, the truth that brings life, <mark> the truth that is the light that those who do not dwell in it do not understand. </mark>

Love is creation, love is sacrifice, love is salvation, love is restoration

We as humans waste so much time arguing the exhistance, point or word of God. That we miss the nature of God and that the point is to embrace the nature of God. Which is love. We are to embrace Love. 

> ** John 1:6-9
> * 6 There was a man sent from God, whose name was John. 7 This man came for a witness, to bear witness of the Light, that all through him might believe. 8 He was not that Light, but was sent to bear witness of that Light. 9 That was the true Light which gives light to every man coming into the world.*

** My Thoughts **
A prophet was sent ahead of the light to testify on behalf of the light to come that when the light made it‘s appearance (known) the people would believe. 

> ** John 1:10-13
> * 10 He was in the world, and the world was made through Him, and the world did not know Him. 11 He came to His own, and His own did not receive Him. 12 But as many as received Him, to them He gave the right to become children of God, to those who believe in His name: 13 who were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.*

* My Thoughts: *
Love was in the world, and the world was made through love, and the world did not know (selfless) love. Love came to those he was in covenant with, the people he had been with, the people he shared himself with and they did not recognize or acknowledge him, but those who recognized, those who acknowledged him, the truth of his Love were given the privilege of going into covenant with God. Not because they were of the lineage of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. No, not because they naturally did good deeds, but because of God sharing himself with them and they simply believed in the truth of God, the truth of love.

> ** John 1:14-18
> * 14 And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we beheld His glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth.
15 John bore witness of Him and cried out, saying, "This was He of whom I said, He who comes after me is preferred before me, for He was before me.'"
16 And of His fullness we have all received, and grace for grace. 17 For the law was given through Moses, but grace and truth came through Jesus Christ. 18 No one has seen God at any time. The only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him.*

** My Thoughts: **
God‘s love his very spirit became flesh and walked with us. We got to see God's spirit, the only perfect example of God's nature and it was full of <mark> grace and truth</mark>. John who was sent to prophesies of his coming and when he saw Jesus he made it clear this is the one I had been prophesying about. The fact that he, Jesus, is (was) here, has provided heapings of grace. In contrast to the law, which in many ways served to condemn, starkly contrast with the grace and truth that Jesus brought. The true message, the true nature, the true heart of God. 

> ** John 1:19-32 **
> * 19 Now this is the testimony of John, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, "Who are you?"
20 He confessed, and did not deny, but confessed, "I am not the Christ."
21 And they asked him, "What then? Are you Elijah?"
He said, "I am not."
"Are you the Prophet?"
And he answered, "No."
22 Then they said to him, "Who are you, that we may give an answer to those who sent us? What do you say about yourself?"
23 He said: "I am
The voice of one crying in the wilderness:
"Make straight the way of the LORD,"'
as the prophet Isaiah said."
24 Now those who were sent were from the Pharisees. 25 And they asked him, saying, "Why then do you baptize if you are not the Christ, nor Elijah, nor the Prophet?"
26 John answered them, saying, "I baptize with water, but there stands One among you whom you do not know. 27 It is He who, coming after me, is preferred before me, whose sandal strap I am not worthy to loose."
28 These things were done in Bethabara beyond the Jordan, where John was baptizing.
> 29 The next day John saw Jesus coming toward him, and said, "Behold! The Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world! 30 This is He of whom I said, 'After me comes a Man who is preferred before me, for He was before me.' 31 I did not know Him; but that He should be revealed to Israel, therefore I came baptizing with water."
32 And John bore witness, saying, "I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove, and He remained upon Him. 33 I did not know Him, but He who sent me to baptize with water said to me, 'Upon whom you see the Spirit descending, and remaining on Him, this is He who baptizes with the Holy Spirit.' 34 And I have seen and testified that this is the Son of God."*

** My Thoughts **
John the Baptist was confronted about who he was. He made it clear he was not the messiah (Christ), not a prophets, but quotes the Old Testament (Isaiah 40:3 and Malachi 3:1), that he is the one sent to announce the coming of the Christ, Messiah, the Lord. He was the herald, the messenger, the person to be viewed as a sign that something (in this case Christ) was coming. Affirming what the word said would happen at the Christs coming. 


> ** John 1:33-42 **
> *35 Again, the next day, John stood with two of his disciples. 36 And looking at Jesus as He walked, he said, "Behold the Lamb of God!"
37 The two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus. 38 Then Jesus turned, and seeing them following, said to them, "What do you seek?"
They said to Him, "Rabbi" (which is to say, when translated, Teacher), "where are You staying?"
39 He said to them, "Come and see." They came and saw where He was staying, and remained with Him that day (now it was about the tenth hour).
40 One of the two who heard John speak, and followed Him, was Andrew, Simon Peter's brother. 41 He first found his own brother Simon, and said to him, "We have found the Messiah" (which is translated, the Christ). 42 And he brought him to Jesus.
Now when Jesus looked at him, He said, "You are Simon the son of Jonah. You shall be called Cephas" (which is translated, A Stone).*

** My Thoughts **
Jesus first two disciple came from John the Baptist disciples. Also worthy of note is that when Andrew was asked by Jesus “What do you seek." They responded with "Rabbi", which is the emphasized one the scripture to mean "teacher". After spending the day with Jesus, Andrew believed. He believed he had found the Messaiah. 

> ** John 1:43-50 **
> * 43 The following day Jesus wanted to go to Galilee, and He found Philip and said to him, "Follow Me." 44 Now Philip was from Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter. 45 Philip found Nathanael and said to him, "We have found Him of whom Moses in the law, and also the prophets, wrote—Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph."
46 And Nathanael said to him, "Can anything good come out of Nazareth?"
Philip said to him, "Come and see."
47 Jesus saw Nathanael coming toward Him, and said of him, "Behold, an Israelite indeed, in whom is no deceit!"
48 Nathanael said to Him, "How do You know me?"
Jesus answered and said to him, "Before Philip called you, when you were under the fig tree, I saw you."
49 Nathanael answered and said to Him, "Rabbi, You are the Son of God! You are the King of Israel!"
50 Jesus answered and said to him, "Because I said to you, 'I saw you under the fig tree,' do you believe? You will see greater things than these." 51 And He said to him, "Most assuredly, I say to you, hereafter you shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of Man."*

** My Thoughts **
It seems like the apostles believed in and had intimate knowledge of the scripture, the writings of Moses and the prophets as well as knowledge of Jesus "Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph"
