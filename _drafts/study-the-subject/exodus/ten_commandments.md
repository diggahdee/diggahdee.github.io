Did Jesus say the Fathers Name or only call him Father? 
- If so what verses? 
- What was the context of the verses? (Prayer, in the temple… other) 
	- according to [link](https://www.thecompassnews.org/2009/01/the-name-that-must-not-be-said-out-loud/) the <mark>Hebrew Adonai</mark> became <mark>the Greek Kyrios</mark>.
		NOTE: can I find other sources that claim that or contradict with that?
