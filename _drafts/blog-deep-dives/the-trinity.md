God the Father (Elohim) - Since the beginning desired to create a kingdom. A kingdom not governed by any king, or judge or person, but one that is ruled by his spirit (Love - spoken to man in the form of the 10 commandments in the OT or 2 in the NT)

... Man failed to. Failed to understand God (Elohim) spirit, failed to submit to his commandments, because man failed to see past himself, failed to operate in Love for Elohim and love for his brother.

In love, God showed man the truth of their nature and the kingdom that they desired. No man by his own spirit will bring peace and purpose to the world. With patience God (Elohim), continue to rescue and remind man what they trully needed, His spirit (his nature). 

Since the beginning he intended for that nature to rule, but man needed to see it in action, and see how serving the flesh (man's self-centered nature will fail), while serving the spirit (Elohim's nature) redeems, removes all sin, gives peace and purpose. God in his infinite wisdom knew the day would come. Knew he would have to show man his glory his way. Show man first how man's desired kingdom was flawed and now (new testament) show man how it could/should be. Enters the Messiah that has been spoken of throughout the Old testament.

God (Elohim) new he had to show man how to love (his nature), show them the power and purpose in it, and get them to desire to live in/by it. God sent his spirit his will (wrapped in flesh... Jesus), his nature to live the life we were suppose to live and die the only death we were intended to, the death to self for God (Elohim's) Kingdom. Showing us the glory, the power of Jesus purpose (our purpose, cause it was ours first) being full filled, what the enemy is and what God's (Elohim's) intended kingdom looks like. This king, this master was the power on earth since the beginning that man gave/gives away. 

Jesus completes his purpose as God (Elohim) willed. Fullfills his role as High Priest, Chief shepard, teacher, master... example. Leaving no doubt what the life, purpose and glory that waits for one who accepts God (Elohim's) ways (nature). Casting out doubt for those who would accept Elohim's ways. Jesus as Elohim's embodied nature returned to the father to wait to "judge" the acceptance of Gods spirit/will. 

Befor Jesus transcended he left believers behind who accepted his ways, but may still have doubted his power. The power to overcome the world. They accepted the truth of God (Elohim), the truth of Jesus (his spirit and will for us), and in acceptig this. Believing in, Jesus (Elohim's will) Man spirit is made Holy (man receive the Holy Spirit). Man is once again connecte in spirit to God (Elohim). This spirit reminds us of who Elohim is, what his will is for us and his will is for our brothers and sisters. As always intended this spirit, this will, the word of God (Elohim), his commandments govern the hearts and spirits of his people not the flesh. That teaching spreads by discipleship. Disciples make disciples (followers of Gods (Elohim's) ways). Connection is once again made through the "Holy" spirit to God and our brothers. Connected by a commom purpose, a common desire to seek the will of the Almighty God (Elohim) to be ruled by his will. That his kingdom will come. 




**Holy Spirit** man accepts Christ thus accepting God as the truth his nature as the truth and puts his faith in his nature thus given a direct connection with God the Father
