# The Ask...  
## Find examples of, "the love" defined in 1 Corinthian 13:4-12 in the old testament.

1 Corinthians 13:4-12 is probably one of the most recognized verses of scripture on love, but is this a New Testament concept or is it present in the Old Testament? Let'take a look.

<span class="scripture">
> **1 Corinthian 13:4-12 ESV**
> *4 Love is patient and kind; love does not envy or boast; it is not arrogant 5 or rude. It does not insist on its own way; it is not irritable or resentful; 6 it does not rejoice at wrongdoing, but rejoices with the truth. 7 Love bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.
8 Love never ends. As for prophecies, they will pass away; as for tongues, they will cease; as for knowledge, it will pass away. 9 For we know in part and we prophesy in part, 10 but when the perfect comes, the partial will pass away. 11 When I was a child, I spoke like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child. When I became a man, I gave up childish ways. 12 For now we see in a mirror dimly, but then face to face. Now I know in part; then I shall know fully, even as I have been fully known.*

**My Thoughts:** 

**SCRIPTURE IN CONTEXT (It's better in context):**
Paul appears to be addressing a collection of issues, questions and/or concerns of the church in Corinth. Paul appears to shift to the topic that contains the verse with 1 Corinthian 12, it begin...

### 1 Corinthians 12:1-3
> **1 Corinthians 12:1-3 ESV**
> *12 - 1 Now concerning spiritual gifts, brothers, I do not want you to be uninformed. 2 You know that when you were pagans you were led astray to mute idols, however you were led. 3 Therefore I want you to understand that no one speaking in the Spirit of God ever says “Jesus is accursed!” and no one can say “Jesus is Lord” except in the Holy Spirit.*

**POINTS FROM THE VERSES:**

- No one speaking in the Spirit of God, would say "Jesus is accursed!".
- One "in" the Holy Spirit would "says" "Jesus is Lord".

**DEFINITION DEEP DIVE:**

- ***"spiritual gifts"*** - I find it interesting and a little off that the word "gift" here has no definition in Strong's concordance. Only the word "spiritual". A little research/googling uncovered that the word [gift](http://lectionarygreek.blogspot.com/2010/01/1-corinthians-121-11.html) isn't in the original text but added by translators, "based on context". 
	- **"spiritual" or "[pneumatikos](https://www.biblestudytools.com/lexicons/greek/kjv/pneumatikos.html)" Strong Conordance (greek).**
		1. relating to the human spirit, or rational soul, as part of the man which is akin to God and serves as his instrument or organ
				- that which possesses the nature of the rational soul
		1. belonging to a spirit, or a being higher than man but inferior to God
		1. belonging to the Divine Spirit
			- of God the Holy Spirit
 			- one who is filled with and governed by the Spirit of God
		1. pertaining to the wind or breath; windy, exposed to the wind, blowing 
	- **gifts or [charisma](https://www.biblestudytools.com/lexicons/greek/nas/charisma.html) Strong Concordance (greek)** - Note: the word gift isn't actually present in the greek translation. It was chosen to be added by whoever translated from greek to english. The absence of the word gift in that verse can have an impact on the meaning. The sentence goes from, "Now concerning spirtual gifts", to "Now concerning (the) spiritual". For the sake of arguement what is the greek word for gift found in the verses that follow 1 Corinthian 12:4.
			1. a favour with which one receives without any merit of his own
			1. the gift of divine grace 
			1. the gift of faith, knowledge, holiness, virtue
			1. the economy of divine grace, by which the pardon of sin and eternal salvation is appointed to sinners in consideration of the merits of Christ laid hold of by faith
			1. grace or gifts denoting extraordinary powers, distinguishing certain Christians and enabling them to serve the church of Christ, the reception of which is due to the power of divine grace operating on their souls by the Holy Spirit

**Additional Thoughts:**	
This scripture gave me pause, specifically verses 1 and 2. It seemed so straight forward, but did't match up with what i had been taught was going on here. Take a moment and re-read 1 Corinthians 12:1-3 then put it in your own words. When done read mine...

> **1 Corinthians 12:1-3 ESV**
> *12 - 1 Now concerning spiritual gifts, brothers, I do not want you to be uninformed. 2 You know that when you were pagans you were led astray to mute idols, however you were led. 3 Therefore I want you to understand that no one speaking in the Spirit of God ever says “Jesus is accursed!” and no one can say “Jesus is Lord” except in the Holy Spirit.*

**STOP** - a useful tool to challenge understanding is to restate what you heard (in this case read) in your own word.

> **1 Corinthians 12:1-3 MOW (My Own Word... Come on that's funny)
> Now concerning the rational soul (spirtual gift), brothers, i do not want you to lack information (be ignorant), because you know before you knew God the Father you worshipped insignificant things (mute idols), based on how you were taught. Therefore i want you to understand that no one talking by (in) the Spirit of the God the Father will ever say "Jesus is accursed [anathema](https://www.biblestudytools.com/encyclopedias/isbe/anathema.html)", and no one can boast or teach ([say]()) "Jesus is Master (Lord)" except by (in) the Holy Spirit.

SAID DIFFERENTLY - its reads to me as a warning (maybe even a chastisement if you look at the verses above 1 Corinthian 11:33-34) against being led astray by false teachers (as they had before) even those who claim to know God the Father. Paul literally...YOU ARE HERE ... HOW DOES HE END THE VERSE BEFORE AND DOES HE APOLOGIZE IN HIS SECOND LETTER FOR BEING HARSH. ALSO LIMK OTHER COMMENTARIES HERE.

**Additional Thoughts - Continue...**

I have always been taught that "spirtual gifts" come to a believer by the Holy Spirit, but if the word gift was not present and the world spritual is pneumatiko, "relating to the human spirit". This could change my whole view. Are thes human "spirits" just the God given talents that you hear people talk about. That girl is so smart, that boy is wise beyond his years... etc. Are these "spirtual gifts" things that God has given us as humans, by his grace. Is the difference when they are used for God's Kingdom, if or when we accept the Holy Spirit. Let's keep going.

<span class="aside">
**ASIDE:**
- is a spirit considered "Holy" when it accept Jesus?
- Are mute or unspeaking idols the things of the world we worship, in many cases in Paul's time these idols also had a god representation
	EXAMPLE:
		- wealth
		- power
		- family/children
		- love / a spouse
</span>

Paul makes two points before diving into the spritual gift.

1. Called out non-Jews (pagans or gentiles depending on the translation) for being led astray by mute/dumb or silent idols(gods)
	- Is there significance in their idols being mute or silent? A contrast between the Jewish God (God the Father) and the other gods of the time?
2. Calls out that they (pagans or gentiles) were mislead before so in order to not be led astray again recognize the spirit your dealing with. One who is speaking in the "Spirit of God" will not say "Jesus is accursed" and one who is filled with the Holy Spirit will recognize "Jesus as Lord".
	- Many of the Jews of the time didn't believe in Jesus. So while they may have spoke of God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. They may have been misrepresenting his spirit.

### 1 Corinthians 12:4-11
> **1 Corinthians 12:4-11**
>* 4 Now there are varieties of gifts, but the same Spirit; 5 and there are varieties of service, but the same Lord; 6 and there are varieties of activities, but it is the same God who empowers them all in everyone. 7 To each is given the manifestation of the Spirit for the common good. 8 For to one is given through the Spirit the utterance of wisdom, and to another the utterance of knowledge according to the same Spirit, 9 to another faith by the same Spirit, to another gifts of healing by the one Spirit, 10 to another the working of miracles, to another prophecy, to another the ability to distinguish between spirits, to another variouse kinds of tongues, to another the interpretation of tongues. 11 All these are empowered by one and the same Spirit, who apportions to each one individually as he wills.*

**Additional Thoughts:**
For me the first 3 lines stand out. Each verse has a link
1. "*Now there are varieties of <mark>gifts</mark>, but the same <mark>Spirit</mark>;*" - 1 Corinthians 12:4
	- gifts & Spirit
		- gifts? - What are the gifts?
		- Spirit? - Is this the Spirit of God or Holy Spirit? Is their a difference or significance to picking one or the other?
2. "*and there are varieties of <mark>service</mark>, but the same <mark>Lord</mark>;*" - 1 Corinthians 12:5
	- service & Lord
		- service? - What are the services?
		- Lord? - "Jesus is Lord". - 1 Corinthians 12:3
3. "*and there are varieties of <mark>activities</mark>, but it is the same <mark>God</mark> who empowers them all in everyone.*" - 1 Corinthians 12:6
	- activities & God 
		- activities? - What are the activities?
		- God? - God the Father.
	- "*variety of **activities**, but it is the same **God** who empowers them **all in everyone**"*
		- God empowers all of the variety of activities? Again what are these activities?
		- YOU ARE HERE - Is this stating God the father is over all. 


> *12 For just as the body is one and has many members, and all the members of the body, though many, are one body, so it is with Christ. 13 For in one Spirit we were all baptized into one body—Jews or Greeks, slaves or free—and all were made to drink of one Spirit.
14 For the body does not consist of one member but of many. 15 If the foot should say, “Because I am not a hand, I do not belong to the body,” that would not make it any less a part of the body. 16 And if the ear should say, “Because I am not an eye, I do not belong to the body,” that would not make it any less a part of the body. 17 If the whole body were an eye, where would be the sense of hearing? If the whole body were an ear, where would be the sense of smell? 18 But as it is, God arranged the members in the body, each one of them, as he chose. 19 If all were a single member, where would the body be? 20 As it is, there are many parts, yet one body.
21 The eye cannot say to the hand, “I have no need of you,” nor again the head to the feet, “I have no need of you.” 22 On the contrary, the parts of the body that seem to be weaker are indispensable, 23 and on those parts of the body that we think less honorable we bestow the greater honor, and our unpresentable parts are treated with greater modesty, 24 which our more presentable parts do not require. But God has so composed the body, giving greater honor to the part that lacked it, 25 that there may be no division in the body, but that the members may have the same care for one another. 26 If one member suffers, all suffer together; if one member is honored, all rejoice together.
27 Now you are the body of Christ and individually members of it. 28 And God has appointed in the church first apostles, second prophets, third teachers, then miracles, then gifts of healing, helping, administrating, and various kinds of tongues. 29 Are all apostles? Are all prophets? Are all teachers? Do all work miracles? 30 Do all possess gifts of healing? Do all speak with tongues? Do all interpret? 31 But earnestly desire the higher gifts.
And I will show you a still more excellent way.
> 13 - 1 If I speak in the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, I am a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal. 2 And if I have prophetic powers, and understand all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have all faith, so as to remove mountains, but have not love, I am nothing. 3 If I give away all I have, and if I deliver up my body to be burned, but have not love, I gain nothing.
4 <mark>Love is patient and kind; love does not envy or boast; it is not arrogant 5 or rude. It does not insist on its own way; it is not irritable or resentful; 6 it does not rejoice at wrongdoing, but rejoices with the truth. 7 Love bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.
8 Love never ends. As for prophecies, they will pass away; as for tongues, they will cease; as for knowledge, it will pass away. 9 For we know in part and we prophesy in part, 10 but when the perfect comes, the partial will pass away. 11 When I was a child, I spoke like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child. When I became a man, I gave up childish ways. 12 For now we see in a mirror dimly, but then face to face. Now I know in part; then I shall know fully, even as I have been fully known. </mark>
13 So now faith, hope, and love abide, these three; but the greatest of these is love.*


**My Questions...**

- What is the verse actually refering to? aka the "context"?
- What's the definition of each of the words used to describe "love"?
- How is this love expressed in the old testament?
