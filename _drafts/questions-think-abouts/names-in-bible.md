## Why do we call him “Jesus”?
### For a while now I have been struggling with why we call “Jesus”, well Jesus and not Jehoshua or Joshua (pronounced “Yeshua”). I have fiends and family that have asked, why are you even asking? Where is this even coming from? I really enjoy studying the bible, and one of my primary resources is the Strong Concordance. The concordance is an index (cross reference) of each word in our bible to the words from the original the source manuscripts. While studying I noticed that Christ name in the concordance was not “Jesus” but actually Joshua. When I asked or looked into “Why”, I get the same ole story of “Due to the absents of characters and the number of times his name was transliterated we landed with Jesus”. So wait we agree his name is pronounced “Yeshua” but that is not the name we call him by? Yes they say because it doesn’t matter may will say. He knows who we are talking to. YOU ARE HERE.. found several references of there being issues with transliterating Joshua or Jehoshua (“Yeshua’) from As a Christian we call Christ (God’s anointed one, our Messiah), "Jesus" (a "translation" of his Hebrew name, which is Yeshua (Jehoshua, Joshua) (a "transliteration") of his Hebrew name? Thought triggered by my study of Luke 3:23-38 ESV.

My Thoughts:

Why do we call Yeshua, Jesus? Is it due to tradition, ignorance, deception? While preparing for a weekly bible study on the book of Luke chapter 3, something didn't sit right with me. We know "Jesus" is not the Christ Hebrew name, yet we use it. Even the statement of "his Hebrew name" since when is a name the sounds that form your name specific to a language. Isn't that the point of transliteration. My name would be my name no matter the language, maybe spelled different that it may be pronounced the same.

## Some interesting facts:

- There are 70± names listed in the lineage of Joseph. Luke 3:23-28 ESV
- Out of the 70+ names only two (Esli and Rhesa) are not an "obvious" transliteration (though they share some of the same sounds.
- "Jesus" isn't even a close transliterationwgoing from Yeshua - - > Jesus
- There is a Joshua/Yeshua in the lineage of Joseph that is represented in our Bible as Joshua, but we retain the name of "Jesus" for our Father's Christ.

Examples from a few "Hebrew site" transliterate his name:

transliterate יֵשׁוּעַ (Hebrew) to Yeshua' (English) (https://alittlehebrew.com/transliterate/)

Example: Using Google Translate

translates יֵשׁוּעַ (hebrew) into Jesus (the accepted english)

Hebrew (יְהוֹשׁוּעַ) - - > English (Joshua)

Greek (Ιησούς του ναυή) - - > English (Jesus of Navi)

Common Ideas as to how Yeshua became Jesus:

"No "SH" sound.. Is the first and last sound the same?

The following video explains it as a lost in transliteration because of going from it's original writing in Greek to English.. And the lack of a letter... (https://www.pbs.org/video/what-was-jesus-real-name-pfsrdr/#:~:text=Jesus'%20name%20in%20Hebrew%20was,the%20episode%20to%20find%20out!)
