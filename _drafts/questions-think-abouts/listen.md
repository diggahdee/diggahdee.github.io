Intentional listening… To Listen with the intent of understanding (also applies to reading)

# Listen.. 
- With the intention to hear first (collect the facts and emotions associated with that which is shared).
Comprehend second (once you feel have shared the facts ask yourself what are they trying to convey? Is their a question, a problem statment, a request or just imformative? 
Ask questions third, to increase clarity (if you think you comprehend or understand, as quetions to increase clarity).
Lastly respond after you understand (validating or challenging (in love) each fact while acknowledging any emotion associated with them, bringing an answer or next step to each question, problem statement or request).
