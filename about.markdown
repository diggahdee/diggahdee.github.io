Seek the simple truths. Share the simple truths. 
God is love. (1 John 4:16)
Love is the intersection of Truth and Grace. (John 1:14; 17)
Love must be expressed in Godâ€™s order. (Matthew 22:37-40)


This whole thing, life itself was an act of love. God is love. Love is creation, salvation and restoration, when done God's way.
