## The character(istics) of God. 

While understandable, I still find myself in awe at how often our understanding... our acceptance of God's character shapes our response to him, our faith in him, our attitude toward him and the world. 

- If we see him as a vengeful God, we seek  vengeance.
- If we see him as a giving God, we seek provisions. 
- If we see him as an absent God, we seek our own way.
- If we see him as an all knowing God, we seek knowledge. 
- If we see him as a loving God, we seek love.

How do you see God? 

Maybe we need to spend more time getting to know God, imagine how our faith, our attitudes, our world might change...
