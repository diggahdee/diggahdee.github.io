<span>
The true power of prayer is not that it always changes your circumstances, but that it gives us new perspective. Prayer allows us to see past the hurt, pain, anxiety... the thing that brought us into prayer and allow us to truly see what is going on find answers, purpose, direction and peace, by tapping into the wisdom of the Father. Remember perspective and peace go hand and hand. I did not say perspective and being pain free, or perspective and happiness, but perspective and peace. Think about it.
