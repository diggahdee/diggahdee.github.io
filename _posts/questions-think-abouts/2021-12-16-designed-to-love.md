No matter who you are, you were designed to love and be loved. What's missing for all of us is a "complete" understanding of what love looks like, feels like and acts like. A complete understanding of who and how to love... 

SPOILER ALERT: 
- The who is easy... God and ALL people.
- The how is a little more difficult. At the center is two words, "truth" and "grace". Want to learn more, I can recommend a book for you. ;)
