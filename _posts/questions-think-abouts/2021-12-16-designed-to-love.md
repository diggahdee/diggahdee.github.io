No matter who you are, you were designed to love and be love. What's missing for all of is a "complete" understanding of what love looks like, feels like and acts like. A complete understanding of who and how to love... 

SPOILER ALERT: 
- The who is easy... It's ALL people.
- The how is a little more difficult. If you like i can recommend a book for you. ;)
