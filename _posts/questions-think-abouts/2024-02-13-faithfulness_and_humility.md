**My Thoughts**

In the dance of divine grace, salvation emerges not as a towering decree but as a simple coin, twirling through the heavens before finding rest in the open palm of a believer. On one side, faithfulness—glistening with the promise to follow the divine path laid out by the one true God. This is the journey of walking in His light, embracing His teachings, His commandments, and His messengers with a heart full of love. It's a commitment to act justly, to love mercy, and to tread humbly upon the earth, serving those in need and honoring the sacred bond between Creator and creation.

On the reverse, humility—a gentle acknowledgment that our strength lies not within ourselves but within the trust we place in God's eternal wisdom. It's the quiet surrender to His will, even when it veers away from our desires, recognizing that His ways are higher, His love deeper, and His grace sufficient for every moment of weakness.

This coin of salvation, ever-present in the believer's grasp, is a constant reminder of the dual call upon their lives: to be both steadfast in faith and yielding in humility. It is a call to mirror Christ, who embodied perfect faithfulness and humility, teaching us that the essence of discipleship is found in carrying our cross and following Him.

For indeed, Jesus did not merely pay our ransom; He illuminated the path of redemption. He demonstrated that the true cost of discipleship is not to evade the weight of the cross but to bear it willingly, guided by His example of sacrificial love and unwavering submission to the Father's will.

Thus, we, as God's children, led to cultivate a garden of both faith and humility: to uphold the truth of His Word with hearts ablaze with love for Him and to navigate our journey with the humility that recognizes our need for His guiding hand. In this, we find the essence of our walk with God—a dance of faithfulness and humility, a melody of divine love that draws us ever closer to the heart of the Father, where true salvation lies.
