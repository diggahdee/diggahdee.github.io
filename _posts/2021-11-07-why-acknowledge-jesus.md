As one who studies the bible it is hard to ignore the many versus of scripture that points to the link between salvation (eternal life) and the belief in Jesus.

<span class="scripture">
> **John 3:16-18 ESV**
>> *<span style="color:red">“For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life. For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but in order that the world might be saved through him. Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only Son of God."</span>*

> **John 3:36 ESV**
>> *Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life; whoever does not obey the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God remains on him.*

> **1 John 5:11-12 ESV**
>> *And this is the testimony, that God gave us eternal life, and this life is in his Son. Whoever has the Son has life; whoever does not have the Son of God does not have life.*

> **1 John 5:20 ESV**
>> *And we know that the Son of God has come and has given us understanding, so that we may know him who is true; and we are in him who is true, in his Son Jesus Christ. He is the true God and eternal life.*

> **John 6:50-51 ESV**
>> *This is the bread that comes down from heaven, so that one may eat of it and not die. I am the living bread that came down from heaven. If anyone eats of this bread, he will live forever. And the bread that I will give for the life of the world is my flesh.”*

> **John 8:12 ESV**
>> *Again Jesus spoke to them, saying, “I am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will not walk in darkness, but will have the light of life.”*

> **John 8:24 ESV**
>> *<span style="color:red">I told you that you would die in your sins, for unless you believe that I am he you will die in your sins.”</span>*

> **John 10:9 ESV**
>> *<span style="color:red">I am the door. If anyone enters by me, he will be saved and will go in and out and find pasture.</span>*

> **John 11:25-26 ESV**
>> *Jesus said to her, “I am the resurrection and the life. Whoever believes in me, though he die, yet shall he live, and everyone who lives and believes in me shall never die. Do you believe this?”*

> **John 14:6 ESV**
>> *Jesus said to him, <span style="color:red">“I am the way, and the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me."*</span>

> **John 17:3 ESV**
>> *And this is eternal life, that they know you the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom you have sent.*

> **Acts 4:12 ESV**
>> *And there is salvation in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved.”*

> **Acts 13:38-39 ESV**
>> *Let it be known to you therefore, brothers, that through this man forgiveness of sins is proclaimed to you, and by him everyone who believes is freed from everything from which you could not be freed by the law of Moses.*

> **Acts 16:30-31 ESV**
>> *Then he brought them out and said, “Sirs, what must I do to be saved?” And they said, “Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved, you and your household.”*

> **Romans 6:23 ESV** 
>> *For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.*

> **Romans 10:8-13 ESV**
>> *8 But what does it say? “The word is near you, in your mouth and in your heart” (that is, the word of faith that we proclaim); <mark>9 because, if you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. 10 For with the heart one believes and is justified, and with the mouth one confesses and is saved. 11 For the Scripture says, “Everyone who believes in him will not be put to shame.” 12 For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek; for the same Lord is Lord of all, bestowing his riches on all who call on him. 13 For “everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.”</mark>*

> **Romans 10:13 ESV**
>> *For “everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.”*

> **Hebrews 7:25 ESV**
>> *Consequently, he is able to save to the uttermost those who draw near to God through him, since he always lives to make intercession for them.*

> **1 John 1:7 ESV**
>> *But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus his Son cleanses us from all sin.*

> **1 John 2:2 ESV**
>> *He is the propitiation for our sins, and not for ours only but also for the sins of the whole world.*

> **1 John 5:10-12 ESV**
>> *Whoever believes in the Son of God has the testimony in himself. Whoever does not believe God has made him a liar, because he has not believed in the testimony that God has borne concerning his Son. And this is the testimony, that God gave us eternal life, and this life is in his Son. Whoever has the Son has life; whoever does not have the Son of God does not have life.*

> **2 John 1:9 ESV**
>> *Everyone who goes on ahead and does not abide in the teaching of Christ, does not have God. Whoever abides in the teaching has both the Father and the Son.*

**My Thoughts:** Above there are 22+ verses some quotes from Jesus himself. Assuming one believes the bible what are some questions one might ask? Assuming one does not what are some things worth understanding?

My Questions...
- What is the biblical definition of Salvation? 
- What does it mean to "believe in Jesus"?
- Why is the belief in Jesus linked to salvation?
- Is beleiving in Jesus the only way to be saved? (Where is the law in all of this?)

## What is the biblical definition of "Salvation"?

> **1 John 2:1-2 ESV**

> **Hebrews 9:24-28 ESV**
> *For Christ has entered, not into holy places made with hands, which are copies of the true things, but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God on our behalf. Nor was it to offer himself repeatedly, as the high priest enters the holy places every year with blood not his own, for then he would have had to suffer repeatedly since the foundation of the world. But as it is, he has appeared once for all at the end of the ages to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself. And just as it is appointed for man to die once, and after that comes judgment, so Christ, having been offered once to bear the sins of many, will appear a second time, not to deal with sin but to save those who are eagerly waiting for him.*

> **2 Thessalonians 1:7-10 ESV**
> *And to grant relief to you who are afflicted as well as to us, when the Lord Jesus is revealed from heaven with his mighty angels in flaming fire, inflicting vengeance on those who do not know God and on those who do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus.

How do you read it?” And he answered, “You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength and with all your mind, and your neighbor as yourself.” And he said to him, “You have answered correctly; do this, and you will live.” But he, desiring to justify himself, said to Jesus, “And who is my neighbor?” ...*

> **Revelation 5:8-9 ESV**
> *And when he had taken the scroll, the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders fell down before the Lamb, each holding a harp, and golden bowls full of incense, which are the prayers of the saints.

> **Revelation 1:1-20 ESV**
> *The revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave him to show to his servants the things that must soon take place. He made it known by sending his angel to his servant John, who bore witness to the word of God and to the testimony of Jesus Christ, even to all that he saw. Blessed is the one who reads aloud the words of this prophecy, and blessed are those who hear, and who keep what is written in it, for the time is near. John to the seven churches that are in Asia: Grace to you and peace from him who is and who was and who is to come, and from the seven spirits who are before his throne, and from Jesus Christ the faithful witness, the firstborn of the dead, and the ruler of kings on earth. To him who loves us and has freed us from our sins by his blood.*








To accept Jesus is to accept God is love, and to accept how much God loves you. 
It is the beginning of how God can work on and in you. You must accept that all that he has done, is doing and will do is out of Love. For you and all of his other children. It’s a change in perspective. 
By accepting Jesus you are accepting that God is the Truth and the light. That he God and his ways are the ways of life and that their is no other way. You are showing faith in God.
That realization opens the door for one to have the capacity to follow his commandments, “'You shall love the LORD your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind.' 38 This is the first and great commandment. 39 And the second is like it: You shall love your neighbor as yourself’” - Matthew 22:37-40
His love shown to others works as a seed on their hearts(mind and soul). Creating the opportunity for them to believe in Love and in turn believe in God. Accept Jesus…


My Thoughts:

The Lord is not slow to fulfill his promise as some count slowness, but is patient toward you, not wishing that any should perish, but that all should reach repentance.
