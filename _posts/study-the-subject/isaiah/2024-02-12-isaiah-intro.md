# The Book of Isaiah

## Why read Isaiah?

In the New Testament, Jesus Christ quotes the Old Testament prophet Isaiah more than any other prophet. Isaiah's prophecies are frequently referenced by Jesus and are used to explain His mission, affirm His messianic identity, and teach moral principles. Isaiah's themes of salvation, justice, and the coming of the Kingdom of God align closely with Jesus' teachings. (see references for more)

Isaiah provides a vivid illustration of the crossroads all believers will face, along with the outcomes of those choices.

## Lessons from the book of Isaiah

### "The Remnant" of God versus "the Estranged" from God
*NOTE: In both cases, there is an awareness of God;*

**Being "the Remnant"** - pleasing God through being a faithful, humble follower of the one true God, endeared to Him.

Characterized by:
- **Faithfulness:** Demonstrated through:
  - Faithfully following and recognizing the significance of God's commandments, teachings, and messengers.
  - Attending to the needs of others with compassion, particularly the fatherless and widows.
- **Humility:** Shown by:
  - Choosing to place trust in God, a manifestation of faithfulness, over oneself.
  - Striving for reconciliation by embracing God's grace and mercy out of love, while acknowledging one's guilt or shame through repentance.
  - *Aside: The sacrificial laws of the Old Testament can be seen as a manifestation of God's grace.*

Resulting in:
- **Salvation** - Achieving closeness to God; Rescued by God from both internal (self) and external adversaries.

**Being "Estranged"** - no longer close to or affectionate to the one true God; alienate from God

Characterized by:
- **Faithlessness:** Demonstrated through:
  - Ignoring God's commandments, teachings, and messengers for selfish gain.
  - Failure to attend to the needs and welfare of others.
- **Pride:**
  - Choosing to place trust in oneself, a manifestation of faithlessness, rather than in God.
  - Exploiting God's mercy and, at best, seeking to appease God out of obligation or, at worst, displaying indifference.

Resulting in:
- **Destruction** - Separation from God; Self Destruction (of/by groups or individuals)

### The cost of salvation - Faithfulness and Humility

# Overview of Isaiah

The Book of Isaiah is a significant prophetic book in the Hebrew Bible/Old Testament, attributed to the prophet Isaiah. It consists of 66 chapters and is divided into two main sections:

- **Chapters 1-39:** focus on warnings of judgment against Judah and other nations
- **Chapters 40-66:** contain messages of hope and restoration for Israel.

The second section emphasizes comfort and restoration, portraying God as a compassionate and faithful redeemer who will restore Jerusalem, gather the exiles, and establish a new covenant with His people. Isaiah prophesies about the suffering servant who will bear the sins of the people and bring salvation to the world.

Overall, the Book of Isaiah is a powerful portrayal of God's sovereignty, justice, and mercy, and it emphasizes the importance of repentance, faithfulness, and hope in God's promises.

# The Kings of Judah during the time of Isaiah

## King Uzziah aka Azariah

### Identity and Reign

- Uzziah, also known as Azariah, was a king of the ancient Kingdom of Judah.
- Son of Amaziah.
- His reign lasted about 52 years, making it one of the longest in Judah's history.
- Reign period is dated from around 792 to 740 BCE.

### Achievements

- Recorded in the Hebrew Bible in the books of 2 Kings and 2 Chronicles.
- Noted for military successes, including the construction of towers in Jerusalem and the desert.
- Dug many wells, contributing to a period of prosperity in Judah.
- Credited with technological innovations in the military and agriculture, enhancing the kingdom's security and wealth.

### Downfall

- Struck with leprosy for attempting to burn incense in the Temple, a duty reserved for priests under Mosaic Law.
- This act led to his isolation, as he had to live in a separate house due to his condition.
- His son Jotham took over the governance of the palace and the land.
- Uzziah's tragic end and leprosy serve as a biblical cautionary tale about pride and disobedience to God's laws.
